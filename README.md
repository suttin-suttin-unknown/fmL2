# fmL2 (aka Project Cantor)

## Preamble

Mathemtician Georg Cantor was most famous for introducing the idea of cardinality and countability in set theory. He proved that certain infinite sets of numbers could be "counted". This bifurcated infinite sets into "countably infinite" and "uncountably infinite".

fmL2 attempts to do something similar with the global set of professional footballers. When looking for new players, how does one know where to start? You might have a set of attributes, you might watch a particular game or competition.
